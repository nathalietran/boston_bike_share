# RAMP starting kit on Bike share system in Boston

Hubway, launched in 2011, is metro-Boston's public bike share program, with more than 1600 bikes at 160+ stations.
Bike rebalancing is one of the most costly and inefficient issues that bikeshare systems face. The constant need for rebalancing manifests in stations with no docks or bikes available. Thus, the goal is to be  able to predict the number of bikes available from stations' historical data and help Hubway avoid stations being full or empty.
